# Classification-spam-email


The concept of "spam" is very varied: advertisements for products/websites,
money-making schemes, chain letters, pornography...
The task of classifying this data set is to determine
whether a given e-mail is spam or not.
Our collection of spam e-mails comes from our postmaster and from
people who have posted spam. Our collection of non-spam e-mails
and personal mail, and the word "george" and the area code
area code "650" are therefore indicators of non-spam. These indicators
are useful when building a customized spam filter. You should either
ignore these non-spam indicators, or obtain a very large collection of non-spam
collection of non-spam to generate a general-purpose spam filter.
